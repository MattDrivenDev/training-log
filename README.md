# Training Log

I want to see how GitHub works as a training log. Nerds, eh?

Might add some `F#` scripts at some point to visualize things etc.

### Notes

* Sets should be noted in order.
* Sets should be grouped by exercise.
* Each training session is a new file, where the filename is the date of the training session.
* All weights are measured in `KG` unless otherwise stated.
* All bodyweight exercises are considered to be `0KG` - and weight noted is *additional* weight added.
